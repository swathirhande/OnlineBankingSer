The proposed system introduces an advanced security approach to protect web applications from various cyber threats using Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP). RASP is a technology integrated within or alongside an application to control its execution and detect and prevent real-time attacks. Unlike traditional security measures, RASP actively monitors the application's behavior and context during runtime, providing automatic protection without the need for human intervention. This self-protecting mechanism is especially crucial for securing web applications, which are frequent targets for attackers.

The system consists of two primary use cases aimed at enhancing application security. The first is the **Self-Protection Tool Inside the Application**. This tool focuses on securing the login process by ensuring that a user cannot log in from multiple browser tabs without first logging out. Each login and logout event is logged with a timestamp and unique identifier, which helps detect suspicious behaviors, such as multiple users accessing the same account. By analyzing these logs in real-time, the application can flag abnormal activities without accessing the database, ensuring the integrity of user sessions.

The second use case involves the **Self-Protection Tool Preventing SQL Injection**. This tool focuses on preventing SQL injection attacks by monitoring incoming user requests for suspicious patterns. If a potential SQL injection is detected, the system blocks the request and displays a 404 error message. This proactive approach ensures that malicious attempts to exploit vulnerabilities within the application are thwarted before they can cause any harm.

The methodology behind this system is rooted in RASP's ability to distinguish between legitimate users and potential intruders. By analyzing user behavior, the system protects the application from emerging threats while ensuring minimal disruption to the user's experience. One of the key benefits of this approach is that it doesn’t require modifications to the existing application code, making it suitable for any web application, regardless of size or complexity.

The implementation utilizes Apache HTTP Server as the web server to manage traffic, log requests, and track unusual activity. It integrates Java classes to validate user access and analyze network traffic. By processing logs and analyzing network data, the system generates policies that prevent unauthorized access, further enhancing the security posture of the application.

The proposed system demonstrates its effectiveness by providing real-time views of the application’s behavior. Legitimate users are granted access, while unauthorized attempts are blocked, ensuring the safety and security of the application. The system’s real-time monitoring and response capabilities make it an essential tool for safeguarding web applications from both known and emerging threats.

In conclusion, the Self-Protecting Application (SPA) approach offers a non-intrusive, effective, and user-friendly solution to protect web applications from various cyber threats. With its ability to analyze user behavior and detect anomalies in real-time, SPA provides a robust security layer that does not require any changes to the application’s source code. This makes it an ideal solution for securing web applications of all types, from simple websites to large-scale platforms, ensuring that they are protected against evolving cyber risks.
